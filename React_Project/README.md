# React Product Management (Frontend Simulation)

This is a simple React app that lets you manage a list of products. You can add new products, search by name, and delete products. All data is stored in memory (nothing is saved if you reload the page).

## Features
- View all products
- Add a new product (simulates POST /products)
- Delete a product (simulates DELETE /products/:id)
- Search products by name

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Start the app:

```
npm run dev
```

3. Open the local address shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173/).

This project is for demonstration purposes and does not use a backend or database. All product data is lost when you refresh the page.
